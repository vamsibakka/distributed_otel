IN THIS GIT REPO WE ARE TRYING TO BUILD A 3-TIRE ARCHITECTURE FOR A PYTHON FLASK APPLICATION: 
* FOR THIS WE HAVE USED DOCKER-COMPOSE TO LAUNCH THE TEST ENVIRONMENT.
* THE NGINX SERVER IS DEPLOYED MANUALLY IN ANOTHER INSTACE AND INSTRUMENTED WITH OPENTELEMETRY, THE NGINX VERSION USED IS 1.26.0 AND THE OPENTELEMETRY VERSION IS 1.26.0 WHICH IS TAKEN FROM THE GITHUB LINK: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp-contrib/releases
THE RELEASE VERISION IS webserver/v1.1.0.
* FOR THE INSTRUMENTATION OF OPENTELEMETRY WE FOLLOWED THE STEPS FROM : https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2022/instrument-nginx/

* IN THIS CODE WE ARE TRYING TO SIMULATE A 3-TIRE ARCHITECTURE WHERE THE PAYMENT SERVICE WILL NOT BE INSTRUMENTED WITH OPENTELEMETRY AND ALL THE REMAINING SERVICES ARE INSTRUMENTED WIHT OPENTELEMETRY. AND TRIED TO OBSERVE THE SPANS WHEN A NON INSTRUMENTED SEVICE IS TRIGGERED FROM NGINX INSTRUMENTED SERVICE
